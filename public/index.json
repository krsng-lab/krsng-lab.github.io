After weeks of intense physical training and getting reprimanded left, right and center, you taking a deep breath to mentally prepare yourself for the road ahead. You long for the day til you ORD. You giggle in the bliss of freedom before it hits you - \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s next after this?\u0026rdquo;\nThe uncertainty of adulting dawns on you. And one major aspect of adulting is money. You\u0026rsquo;re not getting paid enough and you wonder how you\u0026rsquo;re going to survive being two years behind your peers. But you accept your fate with a bitter taste and start to deal with what\u0026rsquo;s given to you. And I hope this article can help you to do so.\nLearning to budget #\rSetting realistic expectations #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s not possible to save your entire allowance. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re having your whole livelihood being funded by your parents, the cost of paying for your own food and drinks, transport, and any big ticket purchases will be at your expense.\nAssessing your needs #\rWe all come from different financial backgrounds. Despite the difference in our circumstances, there is a rule of thumb we can follow, which is to pay yourself first. The first thing you do on your pay day is to set aside a sum of money to pay off your bills (e.g. internet, electricity) subscription fees (e.g. Netflix, Spotify) and debts. Ensure that you keep a detailed track record of all these expenses in a spreadsheet. I personally recommend this spreadsheet created by Lisa\u0026rsquo;s Adulting in Singapore.\nLearning to invest #\rDisclaimer! This is not legitimate investment advice. Anything stated below is my mere opinion.\rYou\u0026rsquo;re in camp and you hear all the talk on stocks, options trading, ETFs, and your mind is a blur. You don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about and you\u0026rsquo;re down with a case of FOMO. You look online for resources and you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to begin. And I can\u0026rsquo;t help you there.\nBut again, there is a rule of thumb that we can follow, which is to invest in what you know. It isn\u0026rsquo;t as simple as knowing what companies you are investing into, or the performances of their stocks. Understand the risks that comes with it. Be mindful in your decision making and don\u0026rsquo;t blindly follow what someone else is doing with regards to investments.\nMindset #\rWith all that said, money is complicated. It\u0026rsquo;s more than just a personal issue, it impacts society as a whole. But what we can do for ourselves is that to have clarity on our personal philosphies with regards to money.\nThanks for reading!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/finances/","section":"Articles","summary":"","title":"Managing your finances as an NSF","type":"articles"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
